# Livestreaming Tutorial

This tutorial provides an example of live video streaming with `Acquire` using matplotlib as a streaming interface. 

:::{attention}
`Acquire` comes with a napari plugin. The code for this plugin can be found in the [__init__ file of the `acquire-python` repo](https://github.com/acquire-project/acquire-python/blob/main/python/acquire/__init__.py). You may also find an example python script of livestreaming to napari [here](https://github.com/acquire-project/acquire-docs/blob/dgmccart-patch-2/docs/examples/livestream_napari.py).

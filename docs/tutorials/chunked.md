# Chunking Data for Zarr Storage

This tutorial will provide an example of writing chunked data to a Zarr storage device.

Zarr has additional capabilities relative to the basic storage devices, namely _chunking_, _sharding_ (in the case of Zarr V3)_, _compression_, and _multiscale storage_.
To enable _chunking_, set the attributes in an instance of the `ChunkingProperties` class.
You can learn more about the Zarr capabilities in Acquire [here](https://github.com/acquire-project/acquire-driver-zarr).

## Configure the acquisition

To start, we'll create a `Runtime` object and configure the streaming process, selecting `Zarr` as the storage device to enable chunking the data.

```python
import acquire

# Initialize a Runtime object
runtime = acquire.Runtime()

# Initialize the device manager
dm = runtime.device_manager()

# Grab the current configuration
config = runtime.get_configuration()

# Select the radial sine simulated camera as the video source
config.video[0].camera.identifier = dm.select(acquire.DeviceKind.Camera, "simulated: radial sin")

# Use a storage device that supports chunking, in this case, Zarr
config.video[0].storage.identifier = dm.select(acquire.DeviceKind.Storage, "Zarr")

# Delay between each frame
config.video[0].camera.settings.exposure_time_us = 7e4  # 70 ms

# Size of image region of interest on the camera (x, y)
config.video[0].camera.settings.shape = (1920, 1080)

# Specify the pixel datatype as uint8
config.video[0].camera.settings.pixel_type = acquire.SampleType.U8

# Collect no more than 10 frames
config.video[0].max_frame_count = 10

# Set the output file to out.zarr
config.video[0].storage.settings.uri = "out.zarr"
```

### Storage dimensions

Because Zarr supports n-dimensional arrays, we need to describe how the data we stream should be interpreted.
We do this by specifying *storage dimensions*, which correspond to the dimensionality of the output array.

Acquire requires at least 3 dimensions: frame width, frame height, and an append dimension.
The first 2 dimensions are required and may be followed by optional internal dimensions.
The final "append" dimension is also required.

Each dimension must have a type, for example, space, channel, time, or other.
This tutorial will use 5 dimensions following the [OME-NGFF specification](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/#multiscale-md).
That is, we will use TCZYX order, with T corresponding to time, C to channel, Z to depth, Y to height, and X to width.

```python
dimension_x = acquire.StorageDimension(
    name="x",
    kind="Space",
    array_size_px=1920,
    chunk_size_px=960
)

dimension_y = acquire.StorageDimension(
    name="y",
    kind="Space",
    array_size_px=1080,
    chunk_size_px=540
)

dimension_z = acquire.StorageDimension(
    name="z",
    kind="Space",
    array_size_px=10,
    chunk_size_px=5
)

dimension_c = acquire.StorageDimension(
    name="c",
    kind="Channel",
    array_size_px=3,
    chunk_size_px=1
)

dimension_t = acquire.StorageDimension(
    name="t",
    kind="Time",
    array_size_px=0,
    chunk_size_px=10
)

config.video[0].storage.settings.acquisition_dimensions = [
    dimension_x,
    dimension_y,
    dimension_z,
    dimension_c,
    dimension_t
]
```

Notice that each `StorageDimension` object has several attributes.
- `name` is the name of the dimension. It is used to identify the dimension in the output array and must be unique.
- `kind` is the type of dimension. It can be `Space`, `Channel`, `Time`, or `Other`.
- `array_size_px` is the size of the dimension in pixels. It is the total size of the dimension.
- `chunk_size_px` is the size of the chunks in pixels. It is the size of the chunks in which the data will be stored.

There is an additional field, `shard_size_chunks`, which is used to specify the number of chunks per shard, but it is 
only used in Zarr V3, which we will discuss in a future tutorial.

The order in which we specify the dimensions is important.
The order of the dimensions in the `acquisition_dimensions` list determines the order of the dimensions in the output array.
In this case, the order is `x`, `y`, `z`, `c`, `t`, which corresponds to the order `TCZYX`.

One more thing to notice is that the first two dimensions' `array_size_px` is the same as the camera's shape.
This is because the first two dimensions correspond to the spatial dimensions of the camera.

## Collect and Inspect the Data

```python
config = runtime.set_configuration(config)

# collect data
runtime.start()
runtime.stop()
```

You can inspect the Zarr file directory to check that the data saved as expected. Alternatively, you can inspect the data programmatically with:

```python
# Utilize the zarr library to open the data
import zarr

# create a zarr Group object
group = zarr.open(config.video[0].storage.settings.uri)

# check for the expected # of directories in the zarr container
assert len(group) == 1

# inspect the characteristics of the data
group["0"]
```

The output will be:
```
<zarr.core.Array '/0' (10, 3, 10, 1080, 1920) uint8>
```
As expected, we have only 1 top level directory, corresponding to the single array in the group. We would expect more than 1 array only if we were writing [multiscale data](multiscale.md). The overall array shape is (10, 1, 1080, 1920), corresponding to 10 frames, 1 channel, and a height and width of 1080 and 1920, respectively, per frame.

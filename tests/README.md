# Testing the Documentation

To test the documentation, you will need to have several packages installed in your Python environment.
You can install them with the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

(You can find the `requirements-test.txt` file in the folder containing this README file.)

Then execute the tests with the following command:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
